<!-- Replace `Example Student` with your name and include your start date-->
# **Saswat Kumar Nayak (2023 - present)**

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**: I'm like a crystal ball gazer, but instead of predicting your future, I predict the behavior of light in photonic crystals! As the resident crystal whisperer in the lab, I use my mastery of machine learning algorithms to unlock the secrets of band structure. Together, we're shedding new light on this fascinating field and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. 

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: New ML architectures, GANs, Maxwell Equations, Solid State Physics.

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**: I helped build this website, master pickle ball and skiing in 10 and 1 day respectively.


<!-- If you have photos you would like to exhibit,
     save them as `/assets/member_images/your_name_photo_#.png`
     and replace example_student below -->
